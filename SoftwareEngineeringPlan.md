I am the sum total of the team, I was to do it all. When choosing the system I wanted to use to try and make my game, I wanted to work with something I hadn't before. Unfortunatly, all of the engines that used a language I did not know, were languages proprietary to said engine. So instead I opted to reuse C# like with my game engine, but to use Monogame. Since I was working with the base functionality of C#, my engine was certainly lacking. As such, I made the decision to stat over. Monogame gave me a lot more errors, but in general was simpler to get very base functionality.
The game plan was to start by getting the sprite on the window, which went well enough. After that I attempted to rotate the sprite, which was my downfall makeing the engine. Despite now using Monogame, rotating an image with C# is still a pain. I couldnt get it working so I went on to the movement to make the walk and slide. Which was problematic but was able to accoplish this task. After getting those to a decent state I went back to try and tackle the rotation, which now works, but for reasons beond me is always the wrong angle. I gt it to a point where it is always offset by 90 degrees, but it wont lt me offset it to the correct angle. This is again where I spent most of my time because, despite using the correct math formulas, C# doesnt like to play nice.
There never seems to be enough time. I neverthought I'd say it, but I'd rather take final exams then have to deal with all of these projects.
