The final version does not meet the design specifications. The plan was supposed to be simple, one class for the sprites and movement, one for the map and its generation.
As it stands there is one class. In said class is a sprite referred to as circle guy, he is the character. Using the arrow keys you can move him around the screen. He has a function intended to be a slide, press shift and you get a momentary boost to speed. A cooldiwn timer has been implamented to avoid overuse. There is a sprite in the files that had not been implamented that was to serve has the dust trail "effect" when a slide occurs, but that did not get implamented. There was also plans to add a jump of sorts to be used in conjunction with the slide to achieve even faster speeds, but again was not implamented. The original design was to have a decen movement system and a randomly generated map. The goal was to find the exit as quickly as possible. Without the map or its generation, the "goal" now is to reach the highest speed possible without touching the sides of the window. 
The rough plan for the map generation was to get a random number for the number of rooms, with one or two connections to oter rooms for each. Each room would have a two dimensional array for the length and width of the room in tiles, using the tile sprite in the files. The exit would appear after x number of rooms have been iterated through, the probablity of which it would spawn increasing as the room number did.
